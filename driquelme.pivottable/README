Project name: "Pivot Table"
Origin: freelance (client agreed to share the project)
Purpose: to simplify work with "SmartXLS" framework (pivot tables)
Dependence: SmartXLS (http://www.smartxls.com/)

Comments:
SmartXLS is a pain in the arse to work with.
Almost none proper documentation or sources.
But it can do pivot tables.
Client asked to create program that would somehow simplify use of "SmartXLS" framework.

"Manual" files attached (pdf).
